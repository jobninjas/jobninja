export const aboutContent = {
  title: "Why we started Nova Ninjas",
  story: "We started Nova Ninjas because we saw too many talented people stuck in the exhausting cycle of job applications. The modern job search has become a full-time job itself - endless forms, repetitive questions, and dozens of hours lost every week. Meanwhile, the people who need jobs the most - those laid off, on visa timelines, or seeking better opportunities - can't afford to waste that time. They need to focus on learning new skills, networking with the right people, and preparing for interviews. That's where we come in. By handling the high-volume application grind, we free job seekers to do what actually gets them hired: building relationships and crushing interviews."
